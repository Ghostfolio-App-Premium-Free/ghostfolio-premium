## üìä What is Ghostfolio Premium?

**Ghostfolio Premium** is an advanced portfolio tracking platform designed for individual investors, traders, and financial analysts who need clear, data-rich insights into their investments. Unlike traditional finance apps, Ghostfolio is **privacy-focused, open-source, and customizable**, giving you complete control over your financial data.  

With **Ghostfolio Premium Free**, you get all the features of the premium plan ‚Äî multi-asset support, advanced performance analytics, allocation breakdowns, and portfolio simulations ‚Äî without any recurring payments. The desktop app version allows for **fast local performance**, offline access to your portfolio data, and tighter security compared to purely web-based platforms.

Ghostfolio connects to various **brokerages, crypto exchanges, and wallets**, automatically importing your transactions and updating portfolio values in real-time. You can track stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, bonds, cryptocurrencies, and even alternative assets like precious metals. The app supports **multi-currency portfolios** and automatically converts values using real-time FX rates.

The built-in analytics engine provides **risk metrics, sector/region allocations, dividend tracking, and performance over time**. Investors can also benefit from **scenario analysis and backtesting**, testing how different allocations or market events could impact their portfolios.  

For crypto investors, Ghostfolio integrates with leading exchanges via API, showing your token balances, DeFi positions, and historical profit/loss at a glance. It‚Äôs equally valuable for long-term investors who need clear portfolio reports and short-term traders who require detailed transaction history and real-time monitoring.
